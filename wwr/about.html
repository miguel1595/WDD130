            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Rapids was founded in 2019 by water and adventure lovers with the goal of sharing their passion for
                rafting.
                What began with a few rafts and local tours soon became a sought-after experience for tourists and
                explorers.
                From the beginning, we focused on safety, fun, and respect for nature.
                Thanks to our professional and committed team, we have grown without losing our essence.
                Today, Rapids is synonymous with authentic adventure on every stretch of the river.
